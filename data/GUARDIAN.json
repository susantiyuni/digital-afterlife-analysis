{"cid": "Ugy0CA5T6b29MruYmc54AaABAg", "text": "My first reaction after viewing the video was the same reaction I had when I first heard the term \"clone\" years ago - I think in a movie where someone had lost a child and decided to clone theirs. That thought repelled me intensely, it didn't feel right because nothing, no matter the advances made, could never really be my unpredictable, sweet, strong, funny little Mikey, except him himself.  My initial reaction was that nothing could or would ever replace the grief I still carry in my heart and soul for my child who I miss with every breath I take. \n\nBut I’ve always been one who approaches life from multiple angles, from multiple perspectives, and I also know well that a picture, video or memory of my Mikey now is salve to my soul - I often laugh and smile at the same memories which previously flattened me for days with tears…..\n\n….and hearing someone else mention his name - or talking about what an impact my baby boy had on their life during his too short one here on earth, all of that is like a huge bandage on the ache of missing him so much….\n\n….because they are affirmations that even although I don’t see him each day now. That I feel him still with me 24/7 over 24 years later, that he was once here, my beautiful golden little boy…..that he lived life fully, always smiled, laughed, played and who was also the mastermind behind some very memorable and funny pranks played upon his Mommy! \n\nAnd every one of those affirmations places a huge warm loving bandage on the pain of his loss. \n\nSo, I can see both sides, I think. I understand this mans reasons for doing what he did and I would guess that a decision like this would need to be a very individual and personal decision, and one based upon a persons own experiences and also at what level of grief they have reached after that loss.\n\nAnd after watching this, I have to wonder - what’s next? That someone who suffered a messy break-up that broke their heart has the ability to recreate the “essence” of that person they broke up with - to spare the broken hearted that heartbreak? Is this technology nothing but a virtual teddy bear to comfort us and cause us to not feel what we as humans should be feeling?\n\nGrief stems from great love and it’s an inevitable part of that love, in my eyes……and I personally, couldn’t do this myself - not under any circumstances - but I do know folks who probably would welcome this technology and to each their own! I respect everyones own choices. Those are choices they have to live with, not I. I have to live with my own. \n\nBut I have to ask, what happens when the network goes out, if there is a malfunction and this cannot be accessed. Grief would follow - it’s a natural human emotion, and I would think it would be almost as devastating as the original loss….\n\nThis feels like yet another something to cause us to not feel what we should naturally be feeling as humans; and if we can’t feel, we can’t grow as humans. \n\nOnly my opinion, as always, but I don’t see any end of grief, because that would be the end of love!", "time": "vor 1 Jahr", "author": "@branchesfound", "channel": "UCrGih02xPLYE2wcAhc4VnjA", "votes": "22", "replies": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/c3Mi3rjsirHNdojXQsaittAfFeQr8fVoYYkMIS8fda1eaCi_aXOdbFpU1nbG6qB1VVpgoBEwaeo=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1731406715.940646}
