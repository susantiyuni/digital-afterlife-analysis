## Between Death and Data: Algorithmic Afterlives and the Ethics of Digital Continuity (2025)

This repository contains the data and code accompanying the paper "_Between Death and Data: Algorithmic Afterlives and the Ethics of Digital Continuity._"
The analysis explores public perceptions and emotional responses to AI-mediated interactions with digital representations of the deceased, based on a dataset of YouTube comments.

## Overview

We analyzed a total of **2,765 comments** from the YouTube documentaries [*"Living Forever Through AI: Digital Immortality and the Future of Death"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTduwK0-sGI) (ENDEVR) and [*"Back from the dead: could AI end grief?"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5udOx8-QxtE) (Guardian). Our methodology combined:

- **Sentiment Analysis** using fine-tuned LLMs (RoBERTa)
- **Unsupervised Topic Modeling** with BERTopic

## Explore the Full Analysis

First, install all dependencies by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To perform the full data processing and analysis, run the [`pipeline.ipynb`](pipeline.ipynb) notebook in in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. 

To download and analyze comments from your own YouTube video, change the YouTube URL in the notebook as shown below:
```
URL = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5udOx8-QxtE" # Change this to your desired video URL
```
This will automatically retrieve comments from the specified video and integrate them into the analysis pipeline.

To visualize the analysis results, run the [`visualization.ipynb`](visualization.ipynb).
