Ugy0CA5T6b29MruYmc54AaABAg,"My first reaction after viewing the video was the same reaction I had when I first heard the term ""clone"" years ago - I think in a movie where someone had lost a child and decided to clone theirs. That thought repelled me intensely, it didn't feel right because nothing, no matter the advances made, could never really be my unpredictable, sweet, strong, funny little Mikey, except him himself.  My initial reaction was that nothing could or would ever replace the grief I still carry in my heart and soul for my child who I miss with every breath I take. 

But I’ve always been one who approaches life from multiple angles, from multiple perspectives, and I also know well that a picture, video or memory of my Mikey now is salve to my soul - I often laugh and smile at the same memories which previously flattened me for days with tears…..

….and hearing someone else mention his name - or talking about what an impact my baby boy had on their life during his too short one here on earth, all of that is like a huge bandage on the ache of missing him so much….

….because they are affirmations that even although I don’t see him each day now. That I feel him still with me 24/7 over 24 years later, that he was once here, my beautiful golden little boy…..that he lived life fully, always smiled, laughed, played and who was also the mastermind behind some very memorable and funny pranks played upon his Mommy! 

And every one of those affirmations places a huge warm loving bandage on the pain of his loss. 

So, I can see both sides, I think. I understand this mans reasons for doing what he did and I would guess that a decision like this would need to be a very individual and personal decision, and one based upon a persons own experiences and also at what level of grief they have reached after that loss.

And after watching this, I have to wonder - what’s next? That someone who suffered a messy break-up that broke their heart has the ability to recreate the “essence” of that person they broke up with - to spare the broken hearted that heartbreak? Is this technology nothing but a virtual teddy bear to comfort us and cause us to not feel what we as humans should be feeling?

Grief stems from great love and it’s an inevitable part of that love, in my eyes……and I personally, couldn’t do this myself - not under any circumstances - but I do know folks who probably would welcome this technology and to each their own! I respect everyones own choices. Those are choices they have to live with, not I. I have to live with my own. 

But I have to ask, what happens when the network goes out, if there is a malfunction and this cannot be accessed. Grief would follow - it’s a natural human emotion, and I would think it would be almost as devastating as the original loss….

This feels like yet another something to cause us to not feel what we should naturally be feeling as humans; and if we can’t feel, we can’t grow as humans. 

Only my opinion, as always, but I don’t see any end of grief, because that would be the end of love!",vor 1 Jahr,@branchesfound,UCrGih02xPLYE2wcAhc4VnjA,22,5,https://yt3.ggpht.com/c3Mi3rjsirHNdojXQsaittAfFeQr8fVoYYkMIS8fda1eaCi_aXOdbFpU1nbG6qB1VVpgoBEwaeo=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,False,False,1731406715.940646,my first reaction after viewing the video was the same reaction i had when i first heard the term clone years ago i think in a movie where someone had lost a child and decided to clone theirs that thought repelled me intensely it didnt feel right because nothing no matter the advances made could never really be my unpredictable sweet strong funny little mikey except him himself my initial reaction was that nothing could or would ever replace the grief i still carry in my heart and soul for my child who i miss with every breath i take but i’ve always been one who approaches life from multiple angles from multiple perspectives and i also know well that a picture video or memory of my mikey now is salve to my soul i often laugh and smile at the same memories which previously flattened me for days with tears… …and hearing someone else mention his name or talking about what an impact my baby boy had on their life during his too short one here on earth all of that is like a huge bandage on the ache of missing him so much… …because they are affirmations that even although i don’t see him each day now that i feel him still with me 247 over 24 years later that he was once here my beautiful golden little boy…that he lived life fully always smiled laughed played and who was also the mastermind behind some very memorable and funny pranks played upon his mommy and every one of those affirmations places a huge warm loving bandage on the pain of his loss so i can see both sides i think i understand this mans reasons for doing what he did and i would guess that a decision like this would need to be a very individual and personal decision and one based upon a persons own experiences and also at what level of grief they have reached after that loss and after watching this i have to wonder what’s next that someone who suffered a messy breakup that broke their heart has the ability to recreate the “essence” of that person they broke up with to spare the broken hearted that heartbreak is this technology nothing but a virtual teddy bear to comfort us and cause us to not feel what we as humans should be feeling grief stems from great love and it’s an inevitable part of that love in my eyes……and i personally couldn’t do this myself not under any circumstances but i do know folks who probably would welcome this technology and to each their own i respect everyones own choices those are choices they have to live with not i i have to live with my own but i have to ask what happens when the network goes out if there is a malfunction and this cannot be accessed grief would follow it’s a natural human emotion and i would think it would be almost as devastating as the original loss… this feels like yet another something to cause us to not feel what we should naturally be feeling as humans and if we can’t feel we can’t grow as humans only my opinion as always but i don’t see any end of grief because that would be the end of love,0

UgynaVRayibitxGvFOB4AaABAg.A8ld2zW3ARJA8yAG8mk7gG,"Spot on. Finally someone gets that it's humans behind the curtain, not AI. Humans, who can use this con artistry to speak in your loved one's voices.

Want to leave your low paying job  with no healthcare? But your dead parent advises you to stay! Says you always quit everything, and how disappointed they were in you. Can't you tough it out for once son? Can't you make us proud?

Want to leave your abusive husband? But your dead grandmother is telling you that you must stay, just like certain politicians want. If you don't take the horrific abuse, you'll have to face even worse in hell, where you will surely end up if you break the marriage vows he broke long ago.

Imagine hearing your dead mother tell you she's in purgatory and suffering and she can only get out if you give the church a certain amount of money to atone.

This is pure emotional blackmail. The sad thing is, it will work.
