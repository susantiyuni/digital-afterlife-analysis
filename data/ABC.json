Please stop, every second you type is making you look silly.\n\n\"My point is people having different opinions and beliefs of AI is not the problem.\" 🤣  \n\nWho said that was a problem, opinions aren't the issue, people can have whatever opinions they want, the issue is when people start to think their AI is actually their real loved one and it affects their actual mental state, their work and people around them, thats when you have the problem lol. \n\n\"the problem with tech is not everyone will see it this way”\n\nDid you not see the context it was used in, it was used in the context of the father. He realised that it was AI and understands its not his daughter. Other users may not see this distinction and this will cause a whole host of mental issues that are currently not fully clear. \n\nIf you have a broad opinion on it, have whatever opinion you want. This is related to the effects on users and their reactions to this tech.\n\n\"you’re in the industry? 😂 is the suppose to mean something special?\"\n\nYes it does, it means you know the problems intimately, it means you see the effects before anyone elses sees them. As I said earlier, my latest project will soon get 300 factory workers fired and out of a job since their jobs are no longer needed given the new vision technology we just built. These people need to go off and find new jobs. It isnt my problem that they are out of a job, but its an example of a problem that will be everyone's problem as the tech keeps getting better. Personally, I think people should retrain and aclimate themselves with this tech but its not going to be easy for everyone. This is just one of a whole host of problems that needs to be solved or at least been made aware of. Governments have to prepare otherwise you have a whole generation/group of people mooching of social security, homeless and jobless and that affects everyone , it affects taxes we pay and the economy as a whole. I know your brain probably doesnt get this far in how it thinks but at least its clear to you now ... right ... If youre in the industry you see things sooner (simple as that).\n\nWhy do you think congress is bringing up and asking openAI, google and other large players to discuss these potential problems and issues. Brining back the dead via gen AI has a whole host of things to consider, have whatever opionions you want about it I don't care, but seriously ... who the f*ck is preaching here ? Simply bringing up discussion points, but guess the internet is full of different levels of intelligence  .. 😆\n\nIf i had it my way, id rather we let this technology go wild and let everyone use it unflitered.

But I think it’s a wonderful tool for those who can actually keep their clarity intact despite their grief.

It would however be nice to have now & especially for his youngest daughter who was only 4 yrs old when he died to hear his voice & get a sense of who he was.  It’s very hard to ‘explain’ his sense of humor etc and I’d love for her to know those things about him that we all loved. He is essentially a stranger to her despite all the memories I have about their time together -she has nothing. Her sisters would have loved a message like this n their wedding days too, I’m sure.
