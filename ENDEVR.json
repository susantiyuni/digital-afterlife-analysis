{"cid": "UgwgMQZ6CA874N3AwRJ4AaABAg", "text": "This film explores these questions with visionaries including Nick Bostrom, author of Superintelligence, Hiroshi Ishiguro, developer of his own uncannily realistic clone Geminoid; Douglas Rushkoff, author of Team Human; Ben Goertzel, founder of Singularity.net who coined the term Artificial General Intelligence; and Deepak Chopra, who is creating his own A.I. mind twin. These visionaries see humanity advancing toward a new age of post-biological life, a world of intelligence without bodies, immortal identity without the limitations of disease, death, and unfulfilled desire. As scientists at the forefront of technology show that a world where humans and machines merge isn’t so far away, we have to ask ourselves will AI be the best or the last thing we ever do?", "time": "vor 2 Jahren", "author": "@ENDEVRDocs", "channel": "UCuw0GgMlZlAsWvpI8PgCN8g", "votes": "130", "replies": "44", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_njolthD8WHPmujl2x58aw29y5cyNPyd7lHmWXkiQTwkWI=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1699701503.813074}

I recall walking alone down the quiet streets while it was snowing. As soon as I arrived home, I saw my mother cooking some dinner. However, I was older, which means that she wasn't alive at that time. It was then that I realized she was a robot; it had some cables at the back of its head. Overwhelmed with emotion, I started to cry as I hugged the robot, remembering that my real mother had died.

By not showing himself and imposing arbitrary rules for being saved, he dooms all the people who are born and have grown up in a way that it is impossible for them to believe in him. I wish i was saved. I wish i could believe. Going to heaven would be my biggest desire. But i have a brain and logic tells me that a millenia old book translated and revised a million times by people of power who have been proven to be evil many times in history may not be telling the absolute truth. Nothing you say, anyone says can convince me it says the truth without doubts. Especially when there are other books saying different things. I was born this way and i have absolutely no choiche but to follow logic, which corresponds to science. I just can't ignore maths, i have more chanche at surviving through science than making up an alternate version of magic man that saves me if i say a magic word. Because the Bible says that if you don't believe you are not forgiven, then i already know that if i wait and do nothing i will be left here to rot, forgotten like an unwanted baby in a dumpster. If the Bible is true then my fate is already sealed, because i'm simply not sure he exists, and it's not my fault, not my choiche, not my wish. Might as well hope it's not true and try to save myself through science. I don't want to be God, but i want to spread love to the whole universe if aliens exist and want to enjoy life together in peace. Life and consciousness is too precious to give up like that to the elements.\nUnless an angel comes down and spanks my butt to prove it's real, i have literally no choiche but to hope in science. Believe me when i say that i cry in silence in my room when thinking about it. I even asked for a sign sometimes. But i can't do anything but to endure this torture and hope it's possible to escape it.

{"cid": "UgwovbqdwAwb797Tm1p4AaABAg.9pk_ZauwgvJ9vZwKIhXNsO", "text": " @cobrat5717  i just changed my name after i understood the philosophy of the Bungie verse, the videogame company that made Halo and Destiny. I grew up with them my whole life and now i understood why i like their games so much and partially why i am who i am now. It does have something to do with this argument too, the argument of choiche, let me explain briefly:\nIn their games they put a deep, hidden and interconnected narrative where the concept of light (altruism, complexity, life, giving, cycle of birth and death, technology, to forget the past to build the future, fundamental forces) is always fighting the concept of dark (egoism, simplicity, death, taking, eternity, ontological concepts, mind, memory). Every universe and timeline has these concepts manifest in different species or ways, in Destiny it's the traveller and the veil or maybe the Witness, in Halo it's the rings and the Flood, in Marathon it's the J'aro and the w'rkanter, or whatever they are called. The two forces often use powers of nature related to vibrations, especially in the Destiny franchise, like quantum fluctuations, quantum fields, in the lore, the fights between them create waves, and these waves create the universes.\nIn each universe, or multiverse, there is always one hero, the protagonist of the story, the player, which is Destiny, it has the power to change, through action, the balance between light and dark to its liking, it has the power to make what is almost impossible happen, it can control luck, it can rewind entire timelines, it can change the story, it lives in a single hero. Destiny is the player, the player has the power to try again every time after it looses, it is capable of winning against all odds by resetting the timeline where he died within the game, it always follows a story even if it's unlikely to happen, it has the power to choose how the world becomes.\n\nI grew up playing these games, i like being someone with the power to change its own destiny, to choose what happens to me if i want. I realise that real life isn't like that, and many times luck controls our life, even if we fight it, and i don't like that. This name represents my hope that there is a way to change your own destiny after all, if not now, maybe in the future, and my attachement to the true power and potential of science (maybe by controlling the waves of the universe, quantum fields and such, we will be able to control our destiny in the future), while simultaneously giving a small love letter to Bungie.\n\nI don't believe in destiny as an entity like the games, or as a real objective thing, i only refer to it as a man made concept that doesn't really exist, that represents basically everything that happened and will happen to something, almost like the arrow of time. To change it simply means taking an action that results in a different outcome, an outcome that you might prefer.\n\nI don't want to die. I really don't want to. But \"destiny\" or simply chance, made me exist in an era where death is very likely to happen to everyone, even if not certain. Death is our likely destiny. I want to fight my destiny, i want to create a ripple, a wave, big enough to change that outcome, through science i might find what i'm looking for, and then, after that, to the stars, maybe trying to find something else and help it achieve the same dreams i had. I wish God would save me, but logically, i have more chance to survive if i help myself instead of waiting for a miracle.\nI want to have a choiche because i realized i don't have one.

Any promises of “digital immortality” in cloud storage is not immortality if it’s just a digital representation of the individual and not the individual themselves. But I think with the help of AI, that technology will become possible, not just this idea of “digital immortality” in cloud storage when it’s not immortality, specially if the person (soul) they’re based off did not live or survive, so it’s just basically a digital replica, but not the person themselves. Digital immortality offers false hope, but the only technology that can do this is the technology that allows the soul to be transferred from one body to either a powerful and advanced computer and into a new vessel/body.

The way an AI system may regurgitate any memories must fall far short of an observer's interaction with the person whose memories they are. Unless AI can record the entire experience of a person, it won't come close in interacting with others as the person simulated or emulated would have done.\n\nAs impossible as that may be, no robotic AI system can come close to approximating the immortal life of a real person. People do not agree on what constitutes a soul, we can't even agree about the meaning of simple words, so it might be a good idea to see what AI can learn about humans and whether we 'understand' disparate things in anywhere near the same way as others.\n\nI envisage great strides in the application of AI, given that there are also great dangers when it is in the hands of evil, careless and or ignorant individuals, but providing immortality to humans is probably nowhere near feasible.\n\nAs Elon Musk has rightly pointed out, we need controls in AI systems and legislation to address those that must be prevented from applying them for evil purposes. \n\nGuns are not evil and AI is not evil, but evil people can use them to further crime or evil objectives.", "time": "vor 2 Jahren", "author": "@InspectorYT", "channel": "UCsy8pOGHX8v-PeXqqLR2B6g", "votes": "22", "replies": "17", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_kMP4DLsW_pPsjlAor0wUOHyNJ6eOMQsuLaKBIVgEoYIw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1699701525.146434}

I was absolutely not expecting to see a \"doom and gloom\" portion in this specific video. In fact, I thought we'd get to see some more impressive inventions instead. I dislike that every AI documentary seems to be doing this now. \n\nAs much as I understand showing the flip-side of the coin, why not just make that its own video? Or at least reflect it in the documentary title in some way, so I don't literally get ambushed with all the negativity out of nowhere. The first part felt more like facts and science, and towards the end we see a pastor who subjectively interpreted the bible; a philosopher; and a teacher of media?

Such AI may exist in a processing unit that doesn't resemble a person or an aggregate of people.

It can establish relationships from volumes of data that would be virtually impossible for humans.\n\nOne would not deem a sophisticated camera or sound recorder to be human and AI is not either, though it uses lenses to capture the visible, as does a digital camera, and digital audio receiving equipment to capture sound. It's processors facilitate the complexity of manipulating the data by receiving or retrieving, altering and storing, as well as producing relevant output. \n\nEven used to control a humanoid robot, it can only simulate or emulate a human; it's not a living being.

As I leaned more about electrical science I realized that every aspect of life has electrical frequencies. All things on earth emit electricity, each emits at different frequencies. So, if you think deeper at how each living thing is able to tell that the body that it controls belongs itself? The reason is because each person has its unique electrical frequency. This is also why identical twins is able to telepathically communicate with one another. It is because they have the same electrical frequencies. The same as cell phone signal. How could the cell phone signal take less than 2 seconds to travel from USA to India? It is because its electrical frequency is unique. All it needs is a receptor. So, in a way human spirit is the same. It is a unique electrical frequency. Each living thing here on earth has its unique electrical frequency. So, the way each living thing can be self aware is by their own unique electrical frequency. That was the reason why those spirits that I saw at 9 years old were still their own individuals, even they died and left their bodies.

You might be able to make a pretty exact copy that acts and reacts in a way indistinguishable from the original person. It may even be able to convince you that it believes that it is the original person. But it NEVER will be. There wont be a way to \"extract\" the soul from a mind and move it into another vessel, leaving a lifeless body behind. Look at it this way. Someone could be dying and you copy them. Then at the approximate moment if death, you switch this vessel ON with all of that persons memories up to the moment of death and it seems like that person is like. \"Wow theres my body! Im here! This feels so different\". But that is NOT that person. The original person just died and God willing there is an afterlife, then that is where that person went. If there is no afterlife they are still gone because that unique perspective you have. YOU have experienced the end and then perished into the void. The copy, even if it is absolutely perfectly executed, is not you. This is a new consciousness that believes it has experienced that persons life. Its not them. Its really a very simple concept that you cannot cheat death. So if you are hoping that you will be able to carry on and live forever, you wont.

{"cid": "UgyvR-ZveaKzX5h6aHp4AaABAg", "text": "I have read two books now by Ray Kurzweil. I think he may be making a reductionist mistake that is also made in this documentary, namely the equating of the consciousness with the soul. I can’t define either one definitively, but is precisely my point. Yes, AI promises the immortality of my personal consciousness and personality. I would be very interested in downloading my consciousness and personality into what amounts to a machine-based intelligence. It might even convince my friends that it was the same as me. But my “meat-based intelligence” would have this one basic difference: it would be the seat of my soul. The machine version would still be an “it”. In Kurzweil’s view, AI represents nothing less than a step in evolution itself. But it can never be an evolution of the soul. I just don’t see human souls ever being able to be downloaded into a machine. Far from being a step in the evolution of humans, it would be a step toward the extinction of humanity. I can imagine a world inhabited by AI’s; one of them might even be a copy of me, and it would probably outlive me by millennia. That would not necessarily be me! When I die, I am finally dead. God will take my soul. I will be with Him forever, or I am completely misled. I’ll take my chances with God first. Nevertheless, I continue to be fascinated with stories about AI; it just can’t promise eternal life of my soul.
