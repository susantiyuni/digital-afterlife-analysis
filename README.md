# Between Death and Data: Algorithmic Afterlives and the Ethics of Digital Continuity

This repository contains the data and code for the paper: **“Between Death and Data: Algorithmic Afterlives and the Ethics of Digital Continuity.”** The analysis examines public perceptions and emotional responses to AI-mediated interactions with representations of the deceased, using data from YouTube comments.

## Overview

We analyzed **2,637 comments** from the YouTube documentary *“Living Forever Through AI: Digital Immortality and the Future of Death”* (ENDEVR). Our methodology combined:

- **Sentiment Analysis** using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs)
- **Unsupervised Topic Modeling** with BERTopic
